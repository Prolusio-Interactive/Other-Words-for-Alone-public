READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO MODIFY GAME

To make your own texture packs in the game, you need to open the jar file with winrar, then all the files will appear.

Next you go to res/textures/spritesheets and select the spritesheet you want to modify.

Then you need to open the png file in your editing program of choice, I use paint.net, I recommend you to use it.

Then you modify the textures that are there, you save the file and apply it to the jar. and that is it.

If you modify the game and want changes to apply to it, you need to play with the jar to see the changes you made.

If you are interested in modding the game with code. You just need to read how I coded it and you will understand how
it works fairly quicky, ONLY MODIFY THE GAME CODE IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, if you dont have previous experience
on programming, you may cause glitches in-game and probably crash it.

Hope this helps!!

USE JAVA 1.8.0 OR ABOVE TO PLAY GAME
