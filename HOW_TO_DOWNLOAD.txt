Robatortas' guide on:
HOW TO INSTALL!

You are probably seeing this because you don't know how to install this.

It's ok! I'll lead you to the way on how to download this.

REMEMBER! That you'r OS will detect this software as possible malware. It is not malware.
Your OS just detects it that way because I haven't signed the game yet. So it is from an unrecognized author.
Meaning that the OS doesn't know if it is safe or not. In the final release I'll sign the game.

Dont worry about the warning. You can just click on "More Info" and at the bottom it will finally appear "Run anyway" ON WINDOWS.

ON MAC I am not sure, Im not a Mac user, you can search it very easily on google by typing. "How to open unauthorized author program on Mac"
And google will guide you through the steps! :)

ON LINUX, I guess you can just sudo the program, I don't worry about this too much, becuase Linux is more of a "Tech Smarty" OS. So I guess you'll
know how to open the file on Linux easily.

!!IMPORTANT!!
A lot of people don't know how to download the game because it is nowhere to be found on the "main"

To download the game. Just simply go to the "Other Words for Alone" repository, and at the right of your screen, you'll see a "releases button".
You click that. and all the game releases will be avalable. :D

Thats it folks!

Thanks for Downloading the Game!
